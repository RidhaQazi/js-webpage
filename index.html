    <h1>Different Approaches In JS</h1>

    <h2>Different approaches to place JS in HTML</h2>
    
    <h4>.Inline JavaScript : </h4>
            Inline JavaScript refers to JavaScript code that is embedded directly within an HTML document,
            typically within HTML tags such as "script", <a>, or event handler attributes like onclick. 
            This contrasts with external JavaScript, which is written in separate .js files and linked to the HTML document.

            <b>Eg:</b> <button onclick="alert('This is inline JS')">Click Me</button>

    <h4>.Internal JavaScript: </h4>
             JavaScript can be added directly to the HTML file by writing the code inside 
             the "script" tag . We can place the "script" tag  either inside <head> or the <body> tag  
             according to the need.

            <b>Eg:</b> <input type="button" value="Click Me" class="inline" onclick="col()"/>    

    <h4>.External JavaScript: </h4>
             The other way is to write JavaScript code in another file having a .js extension and then link 
             the file inside the <head> or <body> tag of the HTML file in which we want to add this code.

            <b>Eg:</b> <button id="mode">Click Me</button>
            
    </pre>

    <h2>Advantages and Disadvantages of each approach</h2>

    <h4>.Inline JS</h4>

    <b><u>--> Advantages of using Inline JS: </u></b>

. Easy to implement for small scripts or quick tasks.
. Can be added directly within HTML tags, making it straightforward for small-scale or simple projects.
. Runs immediately when the HTML element is parsed, making it useful for certain dynamic content that needs to load instantly.
. Embedding JavaScript directly in the HTML can reduce the number of HTTP requests, potentially improving page load time for very small scripts.

    <b><u>--> Disadvantages of inline JS: </u></b>

. Harder to maintain and update, especially as the complexity of the script grows.
. Mixing JavaScript with HTML can make the code less readable and harder to debug.
. Repeating the same inline scripts across multiple HTML elements or pages can lead to code duplication.
. Inline event handlers can be an attack vector if user input is not properly handled.

    <h4>.Internal JS</h4>
    
    <b><u>--> Advantages of using Internal JS: </u></b>

. Browser does not have to make an extra HTTP request for JavaScript code.
. Easy to prototype and test small scripts quickly without managing multiple files.
. For small projects or single-page applications, internal JavaScript can simplify development by keeping all related code in one place.
. It does not allow caching.

    <b><u>--> Disadvantages of Internal JS: </u></b>

. As the project grows, managing JavaScript within the HTML file can become cumbersome and difficult to maintain.
. Internal scripts can lead to cluttered and less readable HTML files.
. Internal JavaScript is not reusable across multiple HTML files. If the same script is needed on different pages, it must be duplicated, which leads to code redundancy.
. Managing changes through version control systems (e.g., Git) can be more challenging when JavaScript is embedded within HTML files. 

    <h4>.External JS</h4>
    
    <b><u>-->Advantages of using External JS: </u></b>

. HTML and JavaScript files become more readable and easy to maintain.
. Allows the same script to be reused across multiple web pages, reducing redundancy and saving development time.
. Page loads speed up due to Cached JavaScript files.
. Encourages modular programming practices, making it easier to structure and manage large codebases.


    <b><u>-->Disadvantages of External JS:  </u></b>

. Coders can easily download your code using the url of the script(.js) file.
. If the external JS file is hosted on a slow or unreliable server, it can impact the performance and availability of your web page.
. If the external JS file is hosted on a third-party server, it introduces security risks such as script injection attacks.
. An extra HTTP request is made by the browser to get this JavaScript code.
